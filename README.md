# EV-Analysis
This repository contains SQL queries and graphs pertaining to census statistics regarding Electric vehicles and their range, price, location, and other factors. This repository may be useful to customers considering buying an electric vehicle or hybrid and are interested in figuring out the most cost-effective option.

The data was aquired from an open source Kaggle Dataset linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/electric-vehicle-population.

Since all of the data was contained in an individual CSV file, there was no need for joining tables throughout the queries.

For all graphing purposes, the software used was Tableau public.

**The results for each query have been added to the wiki along with additional graphs**
